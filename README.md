# hello-world
The tutorial told me to make this file.

I'm a MechE student, looking to dabble into the world of software. 
(Pretty much the opposite of everything I know and have learned so far)

Hopefully, expect more stuff on my account soon as I learn.

As far as I can tell, this is how the process of development with Git goes:

```Ctrl``` + ```Shift``` + ```P```  opens VSCode's (Git?) command line

```Ctrl``` + ``` ` ``` opens the terminal for the branch you're working in

1. Beginning of Session

    ```git pull```

      (or ```git fetch``` + ```git merge```) 
     
      Do this in the branch you're working on

2. Actual coding

    do whatever development you're doing (in the branch you're working on)

3. Updating your changes

    ```git add <filename>``` (or hit the "+" on VSCode)

    ```git commit -m "Message you want to include with commit" ``` 
        (or use the Ctrl+Enter thing in VSCode)

    ```git push```

4. Merging branches

    ```git merge <some other branch>```
       
    (merges some other branch with the one you're in)
